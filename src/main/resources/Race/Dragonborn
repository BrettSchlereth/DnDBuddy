Dragonborn content. I’m tough. If I wasn’t tough, I would have died, long ago. Once, many years ago, I allowed myself to become arrogant, and I became the most evil version of myself that I have ever witnessed. It disgusted me. Because you know me enough now that you know what my abilities are. Imagine if they had no temperance, and I was selfish. Imagine the destruction that I could wreak. I was not a good person. I wasn’t. It was only because of my self realization that, thankfully, my love for D&D outpaced my selfishness, and I was able to re-temper myself. But the thing is that I know that my influence is palpable, and is naturally more destructive. Recently, I’ve been exposed to more people who also have that power at different degrees and specializations. But, for what I’ve noticed, with the exception of probably two, mine is stronger than theirs, and I keep it in check, because, if I don’t, I could really hurt someone. That’s the tragedy that I live. My training prevents me from being- I don’t have the luxury of being emotional. It’s just another adjustment that I have to do in my constant state of service that I live in. That’s why I don’t talk about it. That’s also why I don’t play among us.
